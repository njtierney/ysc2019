Dr. Nicholas Tierney (PhD. Statistics, BPsySci (Honours)) is a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University, working with Professors Dianne Cook and Rob Hyndman. His research aims to improve data analysis workflow. Crucial to this work is producing high quality software to accompany each research idea. Recent work has focussed on exploring data with the R package visdat, and on creating analysis principles and tools to simplify working with, exploring, and modelling missing data with the package naniar. Nick has experience working with decision trees, optimisation, Bayesian Data Analysis, and MCMC diagnostics.

Nick is a member of the rOpenSci collective, which works to make science open using R, has been the lead organiser for the rOpenSci ozunconf events from 2016-2018, and co-hosts the rstats podcast "Credibly Curious" with Dr. Saskia Freytag. Outside of research, Nick likes to hike, rockclimb, bake sourdough, knit hats, and explore new hobbies.
