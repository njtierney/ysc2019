Big ideas of the talk

1. Think of longitudinal data as a time series
2. Identifying interesting observations means reducing a line down to a point
    - Show animation of the data changing from lines to points
    - Filter out the points based on some condition (like top 5, or summary 5) - other points fade out
    - points grow back to lines to represent those "interesting" observations.
3. 

Other fun ideas

1. Can I use a blue / red filter on the lines of the data to "make it pop" (like this? https://github.com/coolbutuseless/ggthreed)

  - The ideas here is that you are using a lens to filter things down
